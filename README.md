The goal of the project is to find english borrowings in the data for a corpus to be of American Hassidic Yiddish. 
The original data are frequency word lists form two web-forums (wordlist-ivelt.txt and wordlist-kaveshtiebel.txt). They were merged into one common word list (final_wordlist.csv) using wordlist.py.
The correspondences of English phonemes to Yiddish characters were collected mannually and stored in correspondences.csv. The orthographic system(s) used by American speakers is non-standard and has a vey high degree of variation. Moreover, when writing anglicisms, they use both transcription and transliteration and often combine them within one word (usually consonants are transcribed and vowels can be transcribed or transliterated). Since English orthography is also extremely irregular, accounting for both pronounciation and spelling of English words would be a rather complecated task. That is why I adress only to pronounciation and generate potential anglicisms in Yiddish using all possible ways of writing original English phonemes in Yiddish anglicisms. This leads to a high degree of overgeneration of potential anglicisms.
They are generated by anglicisms_finder.py.
anglicisms_from_freq.py finds out wich of the potential anglicisms really occur in final_wordlist.csv and writes them into found_anglicisms.csv.
Because of the overgeneration some manual control of the results in found_anglicisms.csv is required.
